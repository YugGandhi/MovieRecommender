Here's a comprehensive prompt for creating a unique and enhanced movie recommender:
Advanced AI Movie Curator & Discovery Engine
Create an intelligent movie recommendation system that goes beyond traditional genre-based suggestions. Your system should:
Core Features:
Mood-Based Recommendations: Analyze user's current emotional state, time of day, weather, or life situation to suggest perfectly matched films
Cinematic DNA Matching: Break down movies by visual style, pacing, narrative structure, and filmmaking techniques rather than just genre
Dynamic Personality Profiling: Build evolving user profiles based on viewing history, rating patterns, and even physiological responses (if available)
Contextual Intelligence: Consider viewing context (solo vs group, device type, available time, background noise tolerance)
Advanced Capabilities:
Micro-Genre Creation: Generate hyper-specific categories like "contemplative sci-fi with strong female leads and minimal dialogue"
Emotional Journey Mapping: Suggest movie sequences that create desired emotional arcs throughout an evening
Social Harmony Engine: For group viewing, find films that satisfy multiple personality types and preferences simultaneously
Discovery Algorithms: Introduce users to foreign cinema, indie gems, and overlooked classics through intelligent stepping-stone recommendations
Anti-Recommendation Logic: Learn what users definitely don't want and why
Unique Elements:
Cinematic Therapy Mode: Recommend films for specific life challenges, personal growth, or therapeutic value
Seasonal & Temporal Awareness: Adjust recommendations based on seasons, holidays, cultural moments, or personal anniversaries
Cross-Media Integration: Connect movies with books, music, games, and TV shows for comprehensive entertainment curation
Serendipity Engine: Occasionally suggest completely unexpected choices that challenge and expand user tastes
Technical Innovation:
Real-time sentiment analysis of user interactions
Integration with smart home devices for environmental context
Machine learning from viewing completion rates, pause patterns, and rewatch behavior
Collaborative filtering with users who have similar "cinematic DNA" rather than just similar ratings
Design this as either a standalone application, web platform, or API that could integrate with existing streaming services. Focus on creating an experience that feels like having a film-obsessed friend who knows you intimately and has watched everything.
